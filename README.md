# knn-classifier
A simple and intuitive implementation of KNN algorithm for classification problems using scikit-learn.

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm using Python and scikit-learn. It demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and visualize a KNN model using a sample dataset, all in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📁 Project Structure  
- `knn.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full code, training process, visualizations, and evaluation metrics  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 💡 Key Features  
- Clean implementation of KNN using scikit-learn  
- Train-test split and model training  
- Hyperparameter tuning (K value)  
- Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy  
- Visualization of decision boundaries (optional)  
- Can be adapted to any tabular dataset  

## 📊 Dataset  
The notebook uses a sample dataset (e.g., Iris, or any custom dataset). You can easily swap in your own dataset by updating the data loading section in the notebook.

## 🧪 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- matplotlib / seaborn  

## 📌 Applications  
- Basic introduction to supervised learning  
- Classification tasks (e.g., customer segmentation, medical diagnosis)  
- Educational tool for understanding how KNN works
